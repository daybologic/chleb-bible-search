3.0.0
=====
The experimental session token backend has been revamped

2.0.0
=====
Upgrading from version 1.3.0 requires a few important changes which will need to be
performed by the system administrator.

Nginx
-----
Your Nginx config will now need to access the fastcgi socket on the local system at
the path /var/run/chleb-bible-search/sock, which only exists after the daemon starts.
please refer to the example configuration under etc/nginx/chleb-bible-search in the
source distribution.

You can also view this file at the following address:
https://github.com/daybologic/chleb-bible-search/blob/master/etc/nginx/chleb-bible-search.example

systemd
-------
If you are using systemd, ensure you update /etc/systemd/system/chleb-bible-search.service
with etc/chleb-bible-search.service because the way we launch is via Plack now, so quite
different to the previous distribution.  You can also obtain this launcher configuration
file from the following address:
https://github.com/daybologic/chleb-bible-search/blob/master/etc/chleb-bible-search.service

once the file is changed, ensure you run

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

FastCGI
-------
If you are running local scripts, they must be modified to use the UNIX socket, and
FastCGI.  See examples under bin/demo/socket-*.sh

Alternatively, access via Nginx (recommended).

Memory usage
------------
The default installation now runs 20 processes, rather than a single process.  This
is a vast improvement, especially in terms of performance and avoiding a denial of
service scenario, but it will mean that more resources are used.

log4perl
--------
We have also changed our log4perl configuration to log the PID.  Please see:
https://github.com/daybologic/chleb-bible-search/blob/master/etc/log4perl.conf

logrotate
---------
We now only rotate files named *.log and rotate weekly, not monthly, it is
recommended that you copy the project config from
https://github.com/daybologic/chleb-bible-search/blob/master/etc/logrotate/chleb-bible-search

Perl developers
---------------
Library constructionTime has been removed as not required for anything useful
translation within Book is now an object, not a scalar string!

Config
------
The config file has changed!  The old config file was:
/etc/chleb-bible-search/main.conf
and the new file is
/etc/chleb-bible-search/main.yaml

This is not simply a rename.  The older config is no longer supported, and the format
has changed to YAML.  This allows us to have a more complex format, and to read the
config from bash scripts.
