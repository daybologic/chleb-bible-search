# Chleb Bible Search

[GitHub release](https://github.com/daybologic/chleb-bible-search)

Welcome to the Chleb Bible Search by Rev. Duncan Ross Palmer

## What is Chleb Bible Search

A self-hostable microservice for querying the bible and searching for content.
The backend Perl library is also designed to be easily integrated with applications.

The service also provides a deterministic verse of the day lookup.

## Self-hosted installation

You are welcome to use our hosted version of the service, at [chleb-api.daybologic.co.uk](https://chleb-api.daybologic.co.uk/).
This is the easiest way to fire up and get searching the bible via your application or website.  However, if you want to install
the service on your own equipment.  Please install the deb file, where possible, an then run:

```
sudo dpkg -i \
	chleb-bible-search_2.1.0_all.deb
	chleb-bible-search-core_2.1.0_all.deb
	chleb-bible-search-dict_2.1.0_all.deb

sudo apt -yf install
sudo systemctl enable chleb-bible-search.service
sudo invoke-rc.d chleb-bible-search start
```

### Web front-end (proxy).

#### Apache

If you have made the microservice work using Apache as a proxy, please contribute and tell us how
you did it.  Otherwise, we recommend Nginx; it's simple, lightweight, and provides everything you
will need to install the project.

#### Nginx

How to install with Nginx (recommended).

With the Debian package, we automatically install the site file to /etc/nginx/sites-available/chleb-bible-search.example,
which you should copy and rename by running:

```
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/chleb-bible-search.example /etc/nginx/sites-available/chleb-bible-search
```

but in any case, you can copy and modify etc/nginx/chleb-bible-search.example in the source code distribution to the
available sites location in the Nginx configuration directory, and rename it chleb-bible-search

Remember to modify the hostname to match your site in the new file!  Also, you may need a symbolic link to make
the site live.  We will not do this for you!  Under Debian, this name will be
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/chleb-bible-search, eg.

```
sudo cp -l /etc/nginx/sites-available/chleb-bible-search /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/chleb-bible-search
```

## Session tokens

The session token support is still considered experimental ⚗️

Session tokens can be turned on so that people who use them correctly have a higher throughput,
because we can see the rate of queries per client, rather than per IP address.  There are not other
functional reasons to enable session tokens at the moment.

Session tokens use SHA-256 for security, which is considered "strong".  That is, they can be trusted
for almost any purpose, including military users (US DoD, HMG MoD).  The session token mechanism means
the code can be certain that they are talking to the same client as it gave the token to previously,
provided TLS is in use.

Multiple storage backends are supported for the session tokens.  More can be written in the future.
Multiple backends can be enabled and configured at the same time!  The caveats is that all backends
must be operational, in order to work correctly.  The order of the backends can also be configured.

The first backend to return the session is used, where-as on save or creation, the session is saved
into all configured backends in order.  If one runs out of space, it will cause an error, so use
this with caution.  We might work on these rules in the future, to increase robustness.

The following backends are supported:

### Dummy

The Dummy backend is a blackhole, you can create and save tokens but you cannot load them.
This is used for test purposes only, and you should not use it on a production server.

You could use the dummy load point for debug hooks or logging, etc.

### Local

Session tokens by default are stored in the (presumably) local directory:
/var/lib/chleb-bible-search/sessions/

This may be altered via the config main.yaml

Sessions will be deleted from disk every month if they are over 30 days old, nb. that means that there can be
a fairly wide-window of up to a couple of months before a session is deleted.  This is to keep load down and
allow a session file to be examined by the administrator for debugging or auditing purposes if required.
Sessions are not routinely deleted at the point of expiry.  Expiry is controlled by the ttl flag within the
config.  Setting the ttl in the config will not extend the life of existing sessions, it will only affect new
sessions.

Sessions may be examined and dumped using the bin/core/session-dump.pl tool

When the package is purged, instead of simply uninstalled (removed), we will delete session files from disk,
unless we detect that an NFS share is in use.  The point of this is that the sessions might be shared between
servers in a cluster, and we use NFS-safe locking to ensure this works correctly.

### Redis

Redis support is preferred over Local!  It's much simpler, there are no Crontabs to clear expired sessions,
and they are instrinsically-safer for clustered nodes.  There is less maintenance for the administrator,
if you are paying for a shared Redis service.

All you need to do is install a Redis server on either localhost (for a single node), or edit the main.yaml
config file to point to the shared Redis end-point.  Ensure you are pointing at the correct database number,
which will typically be 0-15.

### Testing

Please ensure when writing new code that there is a test suite for it.  We ask for this to prevent code
from becoming fragile, so that if any changes are made to your submission, subsequently, we can be
reasonably confident that there has not been a regression.

We have two levels of testing and you can pick at least one, whichever is more appropriate:

For anything involving code which is not directly-related to an endpoint, write a test-suite under
the t/ directory.  This is a standard directory for Perl-authored projects, and uses [Test::Module::Runnable](https://github.com/daybologic/libtest-module-runnable-perl)
Please see the [documentation](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/libtest-module-runnable-perl/tree/master/item/README.md) for writing tests.  Please look at [existing tests](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/libtest-module-runnable-perl/tree/master/item/t) for a guide.

You can run the test suite any time by typing:
```
./Makefile.PL
make && make test
```

You will need to install all build-dependencies first.

For anything involving endpoints code, especially code within [Moose.pm](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/chleb-bible-search/tree/master/item/lib/Chleb/Server/Moose.pm) or [Dancer2.pm](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/chleb-bible-search/tree/master/item/lib/Chleb/Server/Dancer2.pm), please write one or more tests under [data/tests](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/chleb-bible-search/tree/tests/httpie-1/item/data/tests).

These files are a all bash shell files.  Start with [1/template.sh]((https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/chleb-bible-search/tree/tests/httpie-1/item/data/tests/1/template.sh) and copy this. The digit at the start represents the endpoint version.

You can test this by running [bin/maint/run-functional-tests.sh](https://git.sr.ht/~m6kvm/chleb-bible-search/tree/tests/httpie-1/item/bin/maint/run-functional-tests.sh) and specify the 1/name or run all the tests by specifying no parameters.

You will need to edit your /etc/hosts file to ensure that the name [chleb-api.example.org](http://chleb-api.example.org) points to your running code, and set up Nginx.  Remember this does *not* use https (TLS)!

You will need to install [HTTPie](https://www.baeldung.com/httpie-http-client-command-line#bd-1-on-linux) (at least the command-line utilities, if not the full GUI app)

You can also run these tests by typing:

```
./Makefile.PL
make && make http-test
```

nb. if the 'http' utility is not in the path, or chleb-api.example.org does not resolve, then this script exists with a false success case, emitting a warning.
This is merely to ensure the package still builds, and should be obvious.  Don't be fooled!

When building the Debian package, the unit testing framework will automagically execute and any failing
tests will cause the package building process to fail.
