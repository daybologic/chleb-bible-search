=head1 NAME

Chleb::Server::MediaType::Item

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One media item type from an Accept header

=cut

use Chleb::Args::Base;
use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<major>

The major media type, such as 'application', or 'text'.

=item C<minor>

The minor media type, such as 'html', or 'json'.

=cut

subtype 'Part',
	as 'Str',
	where {
		defined($_) && length($_) > 0 && m/^\S+$/ && ! m@^/+$@
	},
	message {
		'incomplete spec'
	};

has [qw(major minor)] => (is => 'ro', required => 1, isa => 'Part');

=item C<weight>

The weight, whose default is always 1.0.  Lower values indicate a backup priority only.
Valid values are between 0.000 and 1.000.  Greater precisions are not permitted.

=cut

has weight => (is => 'ro', required => 1, isa => 'Num', default => 1.0, required => 1, trigger => \&__triggerWeight);

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<toString([$args])>

Return the media type in the standard major/minor format.

C<$args> must be a L<Chleb::Server::MediaType::Args::ToString> object, if present.

=cut

sub toString {
	my ($self, $args) = @_;
	$args = Chleb::Args::Base::makeDummy('Chleb::Server::MediaType::Args::ToString', $args);

	my $str = join('/', $self->major, $self->minor);

	$str .= sprintf(';q=%.3f', $self->weight)
	    if ($args->verbose);

	return $str;
}

=back

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS

=over

=item C<__triggerWeight>

Special trap handler for initial set of L</weight>.

We check that the value does not have too much precison, and is a positive number,
including zero, if not we die with a L<Chleb::Exception>.

=cut

sub __triggerWeight {
	my ($self) = @_;

	die Chleb::Exception->raise(HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE, sprintf("Accept: negative qValue, %.3f", $self->weight))
	    if ($self->weight < 0);

	my (undef, $mantissa) = split(m/\./, $self->weight);

	die Chleb::Exception->raise(HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE, 'Accept: weight (qValue) precisions are limited to 3 digits')
	    if (defined($mantissa) && length($mantissa) > 3);

	return;
};
