Douay-Rheims Bible Text (DR)

The biblical text identified by the translation identifier "dr" in this project
is derived from the Douay-Rheims Bible, an English translation of the Latin
Vulgate published between 1582 and 1610.

The Douay-Rheims Bible is in the public domain.

This project uses a machine-readable JSON transcription of the Douay-Rheims
Bible sourced from:

	https://github.com/xxruyle/Bible-DouayRheims

That repository states the text is provided for free use, but may contain
transcription or versification errors. Chleb Bible Search applies its own
normalization and indexing and does not claim textual authority.

No endorsement by the original editors or maintainers is implied.

The original GitHub repository licence applies to that repository’s code
and formatting only; the biblical text itself remains public domain.
